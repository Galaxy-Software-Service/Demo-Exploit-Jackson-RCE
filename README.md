# Demo-Exploit-Jackson-RCE
Based on the project [jackson-rce-via-spel](https://github.com/irsl/jackson-rce-via-spel) this project serves as an example web application to test multiple attack vectors (file upload, forms) on the Jackson-databind vulnerability. 

## Introduction
Based on an Angular7 frontend and a spring-boot backend different attack vectors can be tested and the results visualized and checked.

## Build
Build and package spring boot and angular7 into a deployable war file.
> `mvn package`

## Run
Which automatically opens a web browser at `http://localhost:4200`. 
> `backend/mvn spring-boot:run`
